1. Update calibration/runtime configs so model weights load in bfloat16 (or FP16) instead of full precision, ensuring hooks and vector saves use consistent dtype.
2. Create a PowerShell script that sequentially runs: env setup (if needed), three calibration commands (truth, cyber, bio), stress-test notebook execution, and an example runtime smoke test.
3. Document script usage in README (brief note) if needed, and verify no lint/test regressions.
